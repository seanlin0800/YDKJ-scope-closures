## Chicken Or The Egg?

There's a temptation to think that all of the code you see in a JavaScript program is interpreted line-by-line, top-down in order, as the program executes. While that is substantially true, there's one part of that assumption which can lead to incorrect thinking about your program.

Consider this code:

```js
a = 2;

var a;

console.log( a );
```

What do you expect to be printed in the `console.log(..)` statement?

Many developers would expect `undefined`, since the `var a` statement comes after the `a = 2`, and it would seem natural to assume that the variable is re-defined, and thus assigned the default `undefined`. However, the output will be `2`.

Consider another piece of code:

```js
console.log( a );

var a = 2;
```

You might be tempted to assume that, since the previous snippet exhibited some less-than-top-down looking behavior, perhaps in this snippet, `2` will also be printed. Others may think that since the `a` variable is used before it is declared, this must result in a `ReferenceError` being thrown.

Unfortunately, both guesses are incorrect. `undefined` is the output.

**So, what's going on here?** It would appear we have a chicken-and-the-egg question. Which comes first, the declaration ("egg"), or the assignment ("chicken")?
