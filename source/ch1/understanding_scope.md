## Understanding Scope

The way we will approach learning about scope is to think of the process in terms of a conversation. But, *who* is having the conversation?

### The Cast

Let's meet the cast of characters that interact to process the program `var a = 2;`, so we understand their conversations that we'll listen in on shortly:

1. *Engine*: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.

2. *Compiler*: one of *Engine*'s friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation (see previous section).

3. *Scope*: another friend of *Engine*; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

For you to *fully understand* how JavaScript works, you need to begin to *think* like *Engine* (and friends) think, ask the questions they ask, and answer those questions the same.

### Back & Forth

When you see the program `var a = 2;`, you most likely think of that as one statement. But that's not how our new friend *Engine* sees it. In fact, *Engine* sees two distinct statements, one which *Compiler* will handle during compilation, and one which *Engine* will handle during execution.

So, let's break down how *Engine* and friends will approach the program `var a = 2;`.

The first thing *Compiler* will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree. But when *Compiler* gets to code-generation, it will treat this program somewhat differently than perhaps assumed.

A reasonable assumption would be that *Compiler* will produce code that could be summed up by this pseudo-code: "Allocate memory for a variable, label it `a`, then stick the value `2` into that variable." Unfortunately, that's not quite accurate.

*Compiler* will instead proceed as:

1. Encountering `var a`, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to see if a variable `a` already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, *Compiler* ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to declare a new variable called `a` for that scope collection.

2. *Compiler* then produces code for *Engine* to later execute, to handle the `a = 2` assignment. The code *Engine* runs will first ask *Scope* if there is a variable called `a` accessible in the current scope collection. If so, *Engine* uses that variable. If not, *Engine* looks *elsewhere* (see nested *Scope* section below).

If *Engine* eventually finds a variable, it assigns the value `2` to it. If not, *Engine* will raise its hand and yell out an error!

To summarize: two distinct actions are taken for a variable assignment: First, *Compiler* declares a variable (if not previously declared in the current scope), and second, when executing, *Engine* looks up the variable in *Scope* and assigns to it, if found.

### Compiler Speak

We need a little bit more compiler terminology to proceed further with understanding.

When *Engine* executes the code that *Compiler* produced for step (2), it has to look-up the variable `a` to see if it has been declared, and this look-up is consulting *Scope*. But the type of look-up *Engine* performs affects the outcome of the look-up.

In our case, it is said that *Engine* would be performing an "LHS" look-up for the variable `a`. The other type of look-up is called "RHS".

I bet you can guess what the "L" and "R" mean. These terms stand for "Left-hand Side" and "Right-hand Side".

Side... of what? **Of an assignment operation.**

In other words, an LHS look-up is done when a variable appears on the left-hand side of an assignment operation, and an RHS look-up is done when a variable appears on the right-hand side of an assignment operation.

Actually, let's be a little more precise. An RHS look-up is indistinguishable, for our purposes, from simply a look-up of the value of some variable, whereas the LHS look-up is trying to find the variable container itself, so that it can assign. In this way, RHS doesn't *really* mean "right-hand side of an assignment" per se, it just, more accurately, means "not left-hand side".

Being slightly glib for a moment, you could also think "RHS" instead means "retrieve his/her source (value)", implying that RHS means "go get the value of...".

Let's dig into that deeper.

When I say:

```js
console.log( a );
```

The reference to `a` is an RHS reference, because nothing is being assigned to `a` here. Instead, we're looking-up to retrieve the value of `a`, so that the value can be passed to `console.log(..)`.

By contrast:

```js
a = 2;
```

The reference to `a` here is an LHS reference, because we don't actually care what the current value is, we simply want to find the variable as a target for the `= 2` assignment operation.

**Note:** LHS and RHS meaning "left/right-hand side of an assignment" doesn't necessarily literally mean "left/right side of the `=` assignment operator". There are several other ways that assignments happen, and so it's better to conceptually think about it as: "who's the target of the assignment (LHS)" and "who's the source of the assignment (RHS)".

Consider this program, which has both LHS and RHS references:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );
```

The last line that invokes `foo(..)` as a function call requires an RHS reference to `foo`, meaning, "go look-up the value of `foo`, and give it to me." Moreover, `(..)` means the value of `foo` should be executed, so it'd better actually be a function!

There's a subtle but important assignment here. **Did you spot it?**

You may have missed the implied `a = 2` in this code snippet. It happens when the value `2` is passed as an argument to the `foo(..)` function, in which case the `2` value is **assigned** to the parameter `a`. To (implicitly) assign to parameter `a`, an LHS look-up is performed.

There's also an RHS reference for the value of `a`, and that resulting value is passed to `console.log(..)`. `console.log(..)` needs a reference to execute. It's an RHS look-up for the `console` object, then a property-resolution occurs to see if it has a method called `log`.

Finally, we can conceptualize that there's an LHS/RHS exchange of passing the value `2` (by way of variable `a`'s RHS look-up) into `log(..)`. Inside of the native implementation of `log(..)`, we can assume it has parameters, the first of which (perhaps called `arg1`) has an LHS reference look-up, before assigning `2` to it.

**Note:** You might be tempted to conceptualize the function declaration `function foo(a) {...` as a normal variable declaration and assignment, such as `var foo` and `foo = function(a){...`. In so doing, it would be tempting to think of this function declaration as involving an LHS look-up.

However, the subtle but important difference is that *Compiler* handles both the declaration and the value definition during code-generation, such that when *Engine* is executing code, there's no processing necessary to "assign" a function value to `foo`. Thus, it's not really appropriate to think of a function declaration as an LHS look-up assignment in the way we're discussing them here.

### Engine/Scope Conversation

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );
```

Let's imagine the above exchange (which processes this code snippet) as a conversation. The conversation would go a little something like this:

> ***Engine***: Hey *Scope*, I have an RHS reference for `foo`. Ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: Why yes, I have. *Compiler* declared it just a second ago. He's a function. Here you go.

> ***Engine***: Great, thanks! OK, I'm executing `foo`.

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope*, I've got an LHS reference for `a`, ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: Why yes, I have. *Compiler* declared it as a formal parameter to `foo` just recently. Here you go.

> ***Engine***: Helpful as always, *Scope*. Thanks again. Now, time to assign `2` to `a`.

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope*, sorry to bother you again. I need an RHS look-up for `console`. Ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: No problem, *Engine*, this is what I do all day. Yes, I've got `console`. He's built-in. Here ya go.

> ***Engine***: Perfect. Looking up `log(..)`. OK, great, it's a function.

> ***Engine***: Yo, *Scope*. Can you help me out with an RHS reference to `a`. I think I remember it, but just want to double-check.

> ***Scope***: You're right, *Engine*. Same guy, hasn't changed. Here ya go.

> ***Engine***: Cool. Passing the value of `a`, which is `2`, into `log(..)`.

> ...

### Quiz

Check your understanding so far. Make sure to play the part of *Engine* and have a "conversation" with the *Scope*:

```js
function foo(a) {
	var b = a;
	return a + b;
}

var c = foo( 2 );
```

1. Identify all the LHS look-ups (there are 3!).

2. Identify all the RHS look-ups (there are 4!).
