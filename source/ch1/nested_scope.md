## Nested Scope

We said that *Scope* is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name. There's usually more than one *Scope* to consider, however.

Just as a block or function is nested inside another block or function, scopes are nested inside other scopes. So, if a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, *Engine* consults the next outer containing scope, continuing until found or until the outermost (aka, global) scope has been reached.

Consider:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
}

var b = 2;

foo( 2 ); // 4
```

The RHS reference for `b` cannot be resolved inside the function `foo`, but it can be resolved in the *Scope* surrounding it (in this case, the global).

So, revisiting the conversations between *Engine* and *Scope*, we'd overhear:

> ***Engine***: "Hey, *Scope* of `foo`, ever heard of `b`? Got an RHS reference for it."

> ***Scope***: "Nope, never heard of it. Go fish."

> ***Engine***: "Hey, *Scope* outside of `foo`, oh you're the global *Scope*, ok cool. Ever heard of `b`? Got an RHS reference for it."

> ***Scope***: "Yep, sure have. Here ya go."

The simple rules for traversing nested *Scope*: *Engine* starts at the currently executing *Scope*, looks for the variable there, then if not found, keeps going up one level, and so on. If the outermost global scope is reached, the search stops, whether it finds the variable or not.

### Building on Metaphors

To visualize the process of nested *Scope* resolution, I want you to think of this tall building.

The building represents our program's nested *Scope* rule set. The first floor of the building represents your currently executing *Scope*, wherever you are. The top level of the building is the global *Scope*.

You resolve LHS and RHS references by looking on your current floor, and if you don't find it, taking the elevator to the next floor, looking there, then the next, and so on. Once you get to the top floor (the global *Scope*), you either find what you're looking for, or you don't. But you have to stop regardless.
