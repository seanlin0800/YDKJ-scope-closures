# You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures
# Chapter 2: Lexical Scope

In Chapter 1, we defined "scope" as the set of rules that govern how the *Engine* can look up a variable by its identifier name and find it, either in the current *Scope*, or in any of the *Nested Scopes* it's contained within.

There are two predominant models for how scope works. The first of these is by far the most common, used by the vast majority of programming languages. It's called **Lexical Scope**, and we will examine it in-depth. The other model, which is still used by some languages (such as Bash scripting, some modes in Perl, etc.) is called **Dynamic Scope**.

Dynamic Scope is covered in Appendix A. I mention it here only to provide a contrast with Lexical Scope, which is the scope model that JavaScript employs.
