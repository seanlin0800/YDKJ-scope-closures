# You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures
# Chapter 5: Scope Closure

We arrive at this point with hopefully a very healthy, solid understanding of how scope works.

We turn our attention to an incredibly important, but persistently elusive, *almost mythological*, part of the language: **closure**. If you have followed our discussion of lexical scope thus far, the payoff is that closure is going to be, largely, anti-climatic, almost self-obvious. *There's a man behind the wizard's curtain, and we're about to see him*. No, his name is not Crockford!

If however you have nagging questions about lexical scope, now would be a good time to go back and review Chapter 2 before proceeding.
