## Enlightenment

For those who are somewhat experienced in JavaScript, but have perhaps never fully grasped the concept of closures, *understanding closure* can seem like a special nirvana that one must strive and sacrifice to attain.

I recall years back when I had a firm grasp on JavaScript, but had no idea what closure was. The hint that there was *this other side* to the language, one which promised even more capability than I already possessed, teased and taunted me. I remember reading through the source code of early frameworks trying to understand how it actually worked. I remember the first time something of the "module pattern" began to emerge in my mind. I remember the *a-ha!* moments quite vividly.

What I didn't know back then, what took me years to understand, and what I hope to impart to you presently, is this secret: **closure is all around you in JavaScript, you just have to recognize and embrace it.** Closures are not a special opt-in tool that you must learn new syntax and patterns for. No, closures are not even a weapon that you must learn to wield and master as Luke trained in The Force.

Closures happen as a result of writing code that relies on lexical scope. They just happen. You do not even really have to intentionally create closures to take advantage of them. Closures are created and used for you all over your code. What you are *missing* is the proper mental context to recognize, embrace, and leverage closures for your own will.

The enlightenment moment should be: **oh, closures are already occurring all over my code, I can finally *see* them now.** Understanding closures is like when Neo sees the Matrix for the first time.
