## Nitty Gritty

OK, enough hyperbole and shameless movie references.

Here's a down-n-dirty definition of what you need to know to understand and recognize closures:

> Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.

Let's jump into some code to illustrate that definition.

```js
function foo() {
	var a = 2;

	function bar() {
		console.log( a ); // 2
	}

	bar();
}

foo();
```

This code should look familiar from our discussions of Nested Scope. Function `bar()` has *access* to the variable `a` in the outer enclosing scope because of lexical scope look-up rules (in this case, it's an RHS reference look-up).

Is this "closure"?

Well, technically... *perhaps*. But by our what-you-need-to-know definition above... *not exactly*. I think the most accurate way to explain `bar()` referencing `a` is via lexical scope look-up rules, and those rules are *only* (an important!) **part** of what closure is.

From a purely academic perspective, what is said of the above snippet is that the function `bar()` has a *closure* over the scope of `foo()` (and indeed, even over the rest of the scopes it has access to, such as the global scope in our case). Put slightly differently, it's said that `bar()` closes over the scope of `foo()`. Why? Because `bar()` appears nested inside of `foo()`. Plain and simple.

But, closure defined in this way is not directly *observable*, nor do we see closure *exercised* in that snippet. We clearly see lexical scope, but closure remains sort of a mysterious shifting shadow behind the code.

Let us then consider code which brings closure into full light:

```js
function foo() {
	var a = 2;

	function bar() {
		console.log( a );
	}

	return bar;
}

var baz = foo();

baz(); // 2 -- Whoa, closure was just observed, man.
```

The function `bar()` has lexical scope access to the inner scope of `foo()`. But then, we take `bar()`, the function itself, and pass it *as* a value. In this case, we `return` the function object itself that `bar` references.

After we execute `foo()`, we assign the value it returned (our inner `bar()` function) to a variable called `baz`, and then we actually invoke `baz()`, which of course is invoking our inner function `bar()`, just by a different identifier reference.

`bar()` is executed, for sure. But in this case, it's executed *outside* of its declared lexical scope.

After `foo()` executed, normally we would expect that the entirety of the inner scope of `foo()` would go away, because we know that the *Engine* employs a *Garbage Collector* that comes along and frees up memory once it's no longer in use. Since it would appear that the contents of `foo()` are no longer in use, it would seem natural that they should be considered *gone*.

But the "magic" of closures does not let this happen. That inner scope is in fact *still* "in use", and thus does not go away. Who's using it? **The function `bar()` itself**.

By virtue of where it was declared, `bar()` has a lexical scope closure over that inner scope of `foo()`, which keeps that scope alive for `bar()` to reference at any later time.

**`bar()` still has a reference to that scope, and that reference is called closure.**

So, a few microseconds later, when the variable `baz` is invoked (invoking the inner function we initially labeled `bar`), it duly has *access* to author-time lexical scope, so it can access the variable `a` just as we'd expect.

The function is being invoked well outside of its author-time lexical scope. **Closure** lets the function continue to access the lexical scope it was defined in at author-time.

Of course, any of the various ways that functions can be *passed around* as values, and indeed invoked in other locations, are all examples of observing/exercising closure.

```js
function foo() {
	var a = 2;

	function baz() {
		console.log( a ); // 2
	}

	bar( baz );
}

function bar(fn) {
	fn(); // look ma, I saw closure!
}
```

We pass the inner function `baz` over to `bar`, and call that inner function (labeled `fn` now), and when we do, its closure over the inner scope of `foo()` is observed, by accessing `a`.

These passings-around of functions can be indirect, too.

```js
var fn;

function foo() {
	var a = 2;

	function baz() {
		console.log( a );
	}

	fn = baz; // assign `baz` to global variable
}

function bar() {
	fn(); // look ma, I saw closure!
}

foo();

bar(); // 2
```

Whatever facility we use to *transport* an inner function outside of its lexical scope, it will maintain a scope reference to where it was originally declared, and wherever we execute it, that closure will be exercised.
